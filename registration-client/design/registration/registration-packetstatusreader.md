Design - Registration Packet Status Reader

**Background**

Registration client application will save the each individual
registration details as form as packet in the local disk and same thing
should be uploaded successfully to the desired location in the server,
where the registration processor has to pick up and process the packets.
After that the registration client will be ***periodically/manually
check the status*** of the successfully uploaded packets. This will help
the Registration client application to ***archives or deletion*** of the
packets based on the desired status.

The **target users** are

-   Server application, which will provide a Registration Status API to
    get current status of packets.

-   Client application, which will upload the packets to the desired
    location where the registration processor has to pick up and
    process. Post uploading the packets, will invoke the Registration
    Status API to get the status from the server. Either Manual / batch
    process would initiate this transaction.

The key **requirements** are

-   Get registration packet status based on id\[s\].

-   Call rest API to get the enrollment statuses for list of enrollment
    ids.

-   Update registration packet status in the table.

-   Display the packet status in the UI if request raised from UI.

-   There are two actors applicable to trigger this request.

    -   Manual trigger from the Registration client application.

    -   Batch trigger from the Registration client application.

The key **non-functional requirements** are

-   Connectivity:

    -   Should able to communicate to the configured URL with proper
        authentication.

    -   The http read timeout parameter to be explicitly set, if client
        unable to connect to the REST service.

    -   Connectivity should happen through SSL mode. The respective key
        to be loaded during the call.

-   Authentication:

    -   While connecting to the server, user authentication is required
        to authenticate by providing the valid credentials.

    -   Invoke the Oauth service to get the 'Access token' and pass it
        along with the request to authenticate the request by the
        server.


**Technical Approach**

The key solution considerations are -

-   Create ***RegistrationPacketStatusService*** and create DTO and DAO
    layer for status updation.

    -   Get list of registration packet by status \[Status: PUSHED\].

    -   Call the Rest API to fetch the status of the list of packet ids.

    -   After getting the proper response, if success update the packet
        status to the

        "registration" and "registration\_transactions" tables with
        desired status.

-   Handle exceptions in using custom Exception handler and send correct
    response to client.

> UI

Create the proper alert success/error to intimate the user.


List of Status provided by the Registration-Processor:

     Rejected - virus found
  -- -------------------------------------------
     Rejected -- unable to decrypt the packet.
     Rejected -- duplicate packet.
     Rejected -- other reason
     UIN Created.
     Reached landing zone.

**Request and Response \[RegistrationStatus REST Service\]:**

Provided the request and response of the 'registrationstatus' service.
This service would accept the single / multiple enrollment id and
respond with the respective status.
