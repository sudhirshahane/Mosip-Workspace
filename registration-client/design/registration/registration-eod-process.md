**Design - EOD Process**

**Packet approval / action/ Re-Register**

**Background**

The Supervisor logs in to the Registration Client and navigates to the
end of day process page to view and act on 'Pending Approval', 'Pending
Action' and 'Re-register' packets. Once the user select the packet and
act on it then capture the authentication and save the information.
Unauthenticated information should not be captured.

**Legendery **
-  user --> supervisior

The **target users** are

-   Supervisor

The key **requirements** are

-- The EOD Process is a configurable for the application, if it is enabled then the below process will be considered. 
    Otherwise the packet will uploaded directly to the server based on the network connectivity.

Pending Approval:

-   User views the list of Registration IDs pending approval.

-   User selects a Registration ID to view registration details.

-   User selects 'Approve'. Alternatively, user selects 'Reject'
    along with the reason for rejection.

-   User repeats steps 3-4 for as many packets as desired or select multiple
    at single shot and provides the approval.

-   User clicks on 'Authenticate'.

-   User provides authntication input any one of authenitcation types 
    [userid/password, userid/otp ,fingerprint, iris or face].

-   User views confirmation of successful approval.

Re-Register:

-   User View the list of registration IDs that have been flagged as
    're-register' during packet status sync from the processor.

-   On click of a registration ID, view the acknowledgement slip for the
    registration.

-   Supervisor informs the individual by phone, email, physical mail or
    physical visit to re-register. This is an offline process.

-   Supervisor clicks on '**Informed**'.

-   If unable to contact the **individual**, Supervisor clicks on
    '**Can't inform**'.

    -   On click of 'Informed' or 'Can't Inform' system shows the
        selected option. Retain the selected button in highlighted
        mode - to be confirmed with UX team. User can change the
        selection any number of times before authentication.

-   Repeat steps 3-5 for one or more registration IDs in the
    'Re-register' list.

-   Click on 'Authenticate'.

    -   In the resulting, pop-up will be displayed based on the confgiured 
        authentication types for the screen level - password, otp, fingerprint, iris or 
        face.
        
    -   If the configured one as bio-metric then scan the selected biometric.

    -   Authenticate with locally stored biometric and display the
        result.

        -   On successful authentication, the actioned packets are
            removed from the '-Re-register' list.

        -   On unsuccessful authentication, the user can retry his
            authentication.

The key **non-functional requirements** are

-   Security:

    -   The bio data captured in the UI for authentication shouldn't be
        stored in the system.

    -   Once the validation completed then clear the same from memory.

-   Log the each state of the packet view/approve/reject/hold:

    -   As a security measures the UIN or any sensitive individual
        information should not be logged.

-   Cache:

    -   The bio data shouldn't be cached into the session object.

-   Other standard NFR, need to be taken care:

    -   Logging, audit, exception handling.

Solution

The key solution considerations are --

-   When user clicks the "EOD Process -- Pending Approval / Action"
    option in menu tab, it should hit the controller
    \[**RegistrationApprovalController.** getEnrollmentByStatus()\] to
    fetch the list of registration packet pending for approval/
    rejection / hold/ action process from database.

-   **RegistrationApprovalController: -** for Pending Approval / Action

    -   Invoke the interface **RegistrationApprovalService** and call
        the **getEnrollmentByStatus(String StatusCode)** to fetch list
        of registrations based on status code from db.

    -   Display the fetched detail in the UI screen.

    -   **userAuthenticate() --** when user clicks the submit button in
        the screen then display authentication.fxml file and initialize
        the respective FPAuthenticationController.java class and pass
        the current controller class as an argument to callback the
        process once authentication completed.

    -   **updateRegistration(String registrationID, String statusComments, String clientStatusCode) --** Once the
        required registration ids are selected and clicked on the
        approval/ rejected/ onhold and authenticated by user then this
        method will be invoked and pass the required detail to
        respective service class.

    -   

-   **FPAuthenticationController**: - for authentication

    -   This controller should be called to authenticate the process
        done by the user in the screen by using his/ her finger print.

    -   initialize (BaseController parentObj) -- it initialize the
        controller and the respective biometric device. If device not
        available then display the respective error and close the
        screen.

    -   capture() -- when user clicks on 'Scan' button, this method
        should be invoked to capture the finger image and store the same
        in the respective object.

    -   validate() -- when user clicks on the 'validate' button in the
        pop-up window then validate the captured biometric against the
        value in the system \[minutia based comparison\]. If success
        then submit the page otherwise display the error message.

    -   

-   **Re-RegistrationController:** -- for re-registration

    -   getAllReRegistrationPacket() -- this method should invoke the
        Re-RegistrationService. getAllReRegistrationPacket() method to
        fetch and render the list of registrations in 'Re-Register'
        state.

    -   updateReRegistrationStatus() -- when user click on the submit
        button in the screen after authentication process this method
        should Re-RegistrationService.updateReRegistrationStatus()
        invoked to update the same in system.

    -   

-   Create **RegistrationApprovalServiceImpl** and create DTO for the
    same.

    -   **getEnrollmentByStatus(String statusCode)** -- invokes the DAO
        class and fetch the client status code specific data from db and
        return the same to Controller class.

    -   **updateRegistration(String registrationID, String statusComments, String clientStatusCode)** -- it collects the
        information from controller and invoke the DAO class .

    -   

-   **RegistrationApprovalDAOImpl**

    -   **getEnrollmentByStatus(String statusCd)** -- return all the
        registration detail based on the provided client status code.

    -   **updateRegistration(String registrationID, String statusComments, String clientStatusCode)** -- this method
        updates the selected record status in the DB by calling the
        respective JPA repository interface.

-   Send an Alert message (say) "Status updated successfully" or an
    error message.

-   Handle exceptions in using custom Exception handler and send correct
    response to client.
