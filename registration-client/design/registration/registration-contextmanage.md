**Design Context Manager** 

**Background**

The Registration client application should create a session and manage
it during the span of the enrollment and other process. The entire
functionality of this application should work only within the scope of a
particular session. The session should be managed for a specific
interval \[eg: 5 mins\] and if the user is ideal and does not perform
any operation during this period then alert should be displayed and
signed off from the application. While signing off, the entire data
inside the object should be cleared off from the memory.

This scope is only valid for 'Registration Client' application and not
for any other application / product in MOSIP platform.

The detailed requirement of the each context is mentioned below:

-   Application Context:

	-   When the application is launched the related context would be 
		 generated and the detail would be stored into that.

	-   This context would be available for the entire span of the
    	 application until it is closed.

	-   This context object shouldn't be closed or cleared off when users 
		 are login or logoff from the application.

	-   While creating and closing the context the respective detail should 
		 be audited.

-   Session Context \[LogIn\]:

    -   Once the user successfully completed all the authentications(s) for log in,
    	 the session context should be created and can hold required information during the session
        valid period.

    -   SecurityContext, User and Registration Center related information should also be
        stored into this object and that will be used all the way
        through the enrollment process when the session is in valid
        state.

    -   Session Context Details:

        -   Session id, Login time, Time of interval, Ideal time, User
            Context, Security Context has to be created once the user logged in
            successfully.

    -   User Context Details:

        -   User id, User name, Registration center, Roles, Authorization
            context details should be present.

	-   SecurityContext Details:

        -   User id, roles details should be present.

    -   The Session context and the internal objects will be cleared off
        when user clicks 'logout' or if the session time expired.

    -   Session Create:

        -   The user session should be created when the user
            successfully logged into the application.

    -   Session Clear:

        -   The user session should be cleared off when the user log out
            or inactive state for a particular period.

**Non Functional Scope**


-   Security :

    -   The individual resident detail **shouldn't be** stored in the
        session object.

    -   Session and user context details to be cleared off when the
        session becomes invalid.

    -   Session should be validated for each delegating calls to the
        controller.

    -   If the user is ideal for some time then system should display
        the alert for user action and if they don't perform any action
        then should automatically signed off and clear everything \[all
        objects\] from memory.

-   Audit :

-   Audit should happen for during applicationcontext creation, session
    creation and clear off process along with user context detail.

-   PI information should not be logged off

    -   Each state of the context creation should be stored into the DB
        for audit purpose.

    -   Important detail of the logged in user
        (password/OTP/Fingerprint) data should not be audited.

-   Thread:

    -   The background additional thread created when user login to the
        application to be cleared off when user close the application or
        log off from the application or the system log off automatically
        due to the idle time of the user .

-   Cache :

    -   Data cached are to be cleared off when the user logged off.

-   Exception :

    -   Any exception occurred during the context creation the same will
        be reported to the user with the user understandable exception.

-   Data History :

    -   Maintain the Login time, logout time and other high level info
        in the database table.

-   Configuration:

    -   Session time out

    -   Time interval for user alert during user ideal time.

    -   


**Solution**

In this section the detailed technical approach of the below contexts
are explained:

  **Classes**           **Pattern and detail**
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Application Context   Singleton pattern
  Session Context       Singleton pattern
  User Context          As an inner class of Session Context and should not be accessible outside the Session context class.
  Security Context		As an inner class of Session Context and should not be accessible outside the Session context class. 

**Application Context :**

The detailed technical process for application context creation when
user opened the application.

-   Create an '**ApplicationContext'** business object using singleton
    pattern and load the required application related information into
    the respective context.

    -   Load the [configuration](#configuration) file using

        -   **Sample :-**

            -   \<context:property-placeholder
                location=\"{file:database.properties or
                classpath:db.properties}\" /\>

            -   \<property name=\"driverClassName\"
                value=\"\${sqlserver.jdbc.driverClassName}\"

    -   Shouldn't have provision to modify the loaded configuration
        data.

    -   Provide getter and setter method to load the application related
        information.

    -   The loaded data should be available during the entire life span
        of the application.

        Create private attributes with the following names to hold the
        application related information.

    -   Application id from configuration file \['Registration'\]

    -   Application UUID.

    -   Created datetime

    -   ResourceBundle

    -   Client IP address.

    -   Mac ID.

    -   Connected Device IDs.

    -   Load the entire application configuration using spring
        configuration.

-   When the object is initialized, invoke kernel provided
    'AuditManager' component to insert the audit information into the
    respective table during context creation and exit.

**Session Context/ User Context :**

The following technical process would be followed when user logging
into the Registration application.

-   Create a Java component as '**Session Context'** with **singleton
    pattern** method.

-   The application Session, Security and User context would be created when the
    user login to the application.

-   **Session context** will have the details of id, User context, Security context, Login
    time, Refreshed Date Time, Timeout Interval, Ideal Time and AuthToken.

-   Unique id generated for the session using uuid.

-   User level details will be maintained in user context.

-	Security related details will be maintained in security context.

-   Login time has user logged in time.

-   Refreshed Date Time has to be updated for subsequent user calls.

-   Timeout interval and Ideal time has to be loaded from config files.


-   **User context** is part of session context, it contains the user
    detail -- user id, name, Roles, *RegistrationCenterDetailDTO*,
    *AuthorizationDTO*.

-   This object should be created inside the ***Session context as inner
    class*** and ***outside classes should not have*** permission to
    create it.

    -   Id, Name, Role denotes user id, user name and user role.

    -   RegistrationCenterDetailDTO will have the details of geo location,
        location code, Center registration code, Center code, Center
        type code.
        
    -   AuthorizationDTO will have screen authorization related 
    	 details with respect to roles 

-   This object creation and destroy will be taken care by the
    SessionContext component.

-   While creating and clear off object the detail should be audited.

-   Map the data from UserDTO to this context object, which was fetched
    from DB during login process.
    
-   **Security context** is part of session context, it contains the user
    detail -- user id, Roles.

-   This object should be created inside the ***Session context as inner
    class*** and ***outside classes should not have*** permission to
    create it.

    -   Id, Role denotes user id and user roles.

-   This object creation and destroy will be taken care by the
    SessionContext component.

-   While creating and clear off object the detail should be audited.

-   Functions to be added in the Session Context to support the business
    functionality.

  create()   					Should be created with current datetime and initiate the map and other attributes. 
								While creating the session object, the detail should be audited.

  isSessionContextAvailable()   Checks and return the instance of session context object
	
  destroySession()      		Invalidate the entire session object along with the user context and security context 								object. While clear off the session object, the detail should be audited.
								
  getInstance()     			Returns the current instance of the Session Context object
  
  getUserContext()  			Returns user context object.
  
  getSecurityContext()			Returns security context object.
  
  map()     					Returns the map object of the session context
  
  createSecurityContext()   	Create the security context object and load all the user and center related details to 								session context object

**Session Validation**

This should be implemented during the following cases.
